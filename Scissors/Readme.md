# Renzetti Scissors Production Planning

## Overview
This project is part of the **Data Analysis Bootcamp by Quera**. The goal is to analyze and optimize the production plan for Renzetti Scissors by minimizing costs while ensuring the production demand is met.

## Problem Statement
Renzetti needs to produce **5000 scissors** consisting of three parts: **body, blade, and pivot**. Each part undergoes three production stages: **molding, finishing, and testing**. Due to capacity limitations, the company considers outsourcing some production steps.

The provided data includes:
- **Processing time per unit** for each stage.
- **Available capacity** for in-house production.
- **Costs per unit** for both in-house and outsourced production.

### Given Production Plan & Cost Calculation
A proposed production plan was analyzed to check feasibility and cost-effectiveness.

### Cost Optimization
A more cost-efficient production plan was developed to minimize the total cost while staying within capacity limits.

## Implementation
The analysis was performed using **Solver in Excel** to find the optimal solution by setting constraints on available capacity and minimizing costs.

## Conclusion
The optimized production plan reduces costs while ensuring that all manufacturing constraints are satisfied.
