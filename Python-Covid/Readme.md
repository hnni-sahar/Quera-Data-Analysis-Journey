# Python Exercises - Quera Data Analysis Bootcamp

This repository contains solutions to various Python exercises I completed during the Quera Data Analysis Bootcamp. The exercises primarily focus on data analysis using the pandas library and involve analyzing COVID-19 data from different countries for a specific day in 2020.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Top 10 Countries with the Most Cases
Calculate `Total_Cases` from the `Incident_Rate` and identify the top 10 countries with the highest cases. Save the results in `top10cases.csv`.

### Exercise 2: Countries with the Highest Recovery Rate
Calculate `Recovery_Rate` (recovered/confirmed) for each country, filter countries with high confirmed cases, and sort by recovery rate. Save the results in `recovery_rate.csv`.

### Exercise 3: Comparing Countries with Iran
Compare Iran's data with countries that have higher confirmed cases but lower death rates. Save the results in `vsiran.csv`.

### Exercise 4: Verifying a Health Ministry Claim
Calculate `death_ratio` (deaths/confirmed), exclude the bottom 20% countries with fewest confirmed cases, and identify the top 20% countries with the highest death ratio. Save the results in `20percent.csv`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
