# Olympic Medal Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of a Quera Data Analysis Bootcamp and a Python learning exercise, where we analyze the dataset of Olympic medal winners from 1896 to 2012. The goal is to visualize different aspects of the dataset using **matplotlib** as the only allowed library for visualization.

## Visualizations

### 1. Top 10 Countries by Gold Medals (Bar Chart)

A bar chart is created to display the top 10 countries that have won the most **gold medals** in the Olympics.

### 2. Medals Won per Year by Gender (Line Chart)

A line chart is used to show the number of medals won in each year, categorized by gender.

### 3. Slovakia's Medal Distribution by Sport (Donut Charts)

To analyze the medals won by Slovakia (`SVK`):

- A **donut chart** is created to show the number of medals won in different sports.
- Inside this chart, another **donut chart** is added to illustrate the breakdown of gold, silver, and bronze medals in each sport.

## Requirements

- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas (for data handling)

## How to Run

1. Load the dataset.
2. Use matplotlib to create the required visualizations.
3. Analyze the trends and insights from the charts.

## Conclusion

This project is part of the Quera Data Analysis course, which focuses on Python, where we analyze the dataset of Olympic medal winners from 1896 to 2012.
