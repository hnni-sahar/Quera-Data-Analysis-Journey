# **Basketball Data Analysis Project**  

A collaborative project from the **Quera Data Analysis Bootcamp (QBC8)** by **Sahar Hannani, Behrad Badeli, and Milad Zeinali**, mentored by **Parsa Behmanesh**. The project involves **web scraping, database design, and statistical analysis** using data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com).  

## **Project Phases**  
1. **Web Scraping**: Extract player and team data (e.g., height, age, stats, team details).  
2. **Database Design**: Store structured data in an RDBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL.  
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and metric design.  

## **Key Analysis Questions**  
- Compare **player height distribution** in the "Michael Jordan Trophy" list vs. top 50 players (2019-2024).  
- Analyze **team performance**, comparing top champion players with previous season's top 15.  
- Identify **top Point Guards** based on "Michael Jordan Trophy" appearances.  

## **Hypothesis Testing**  
- **Agility improvement** (height/weight ratio) among top 20 players over time.  
- **Player ability improvement** in champion teams (experience/age ratio).  

## **Tools & Best Practices**  
- **Technologies**: Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels), MySQL/PostgreSQL.  
- **Success Factors**: Clean code, Git collaboration, strong documentation, insightful visualizations, and a compelling final presentation.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project provides a structured approach to analyzing basketball data, from data collection to statistical insights. By leveraging web scraping, database management, and analytical techniques, the findings can help teams make data-driven decisions. The project also strengthens teamwork and technical skills, making it a valuable experience for all participants.
