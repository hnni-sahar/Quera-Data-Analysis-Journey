### **Box Plot vs. Histogram Analysis of Tax Data**  

This analysis is part of the **Statistics and Probability** question from the **Quera Data Camp Analysis**, using data from the **Boston Housing Dataset**.  

1. **Data Concentration Around the Median:**  
   - The **box plot** shows that the median tax value is slightly above **300**.  
   - The **histogram** confirms this, as the highest frequency is observed between **250 and 350**.  

2. **Bimodal Distribution:**  
   - The histogram reveals two peaks: one around **300** and another near **700**.  
   - This is not evident in the box plot, as it only displays quartiles and does not capture the full shape of the distribution.  

3. **Skewness Observation:**  
   - The box plot suggested a **mostly symmetric** distribution.  
   - However, the histogram indicates a possible **right-skewed (positively skewed) or bimodal distribution**, as there is a group of houses with significantly higher tax values (~700).  

### **Conclusion:**  
- While the box plot provided a general summary of the distribution, it **missed the bimodal nature** of the data.  
- The histogram and KDE plot revealed that a subset of houses has **much higher tax values**, which could impact further analysis.  
- For a better understanding, calculating the **mean and standard deviation** can help determine if the mean is pulled toward higher tax values.
