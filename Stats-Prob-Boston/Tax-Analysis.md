# Tax Analysis for Boston Housing Dataset

The analysis is based on the **Boston Housing dataset**, which includes information on housing values, tax rates, and other features. This analysis was part of the **DetailedBoston** question in the **Statistics and Probability** section of my **Quera Data Analysis Bootcamp**.

## Questions and Answers:

1. **What is the distribution of tax values in the dataset?**
   - The distribution is not uniform, with multiple peaks indicating frequent tax values in certain ranges.

2. **Are there any patterns in the tax values?**
   - Yes, tax values around **300 and 700** are more frequent, possibly indicating specific tax bands.

3. **What is the range of tax values?**
   - Tax values range from **200 to 700**, with frequent values near **300 and 700**.

4. **What does the shape of the distribution look like?**
   - The distribution is bimodal with multiple peaks, suggesting the presence of specific tax thresholds.

5. **What tax values appear most frequently?**
   - Tax values around **300 and 700** appear most frequently, likely due to tax bands in different regions.

6. **Is there any correlation between tax values and other features?**
   - A correlation analysis could reveal that higher tax values are linked to wealthier or more industrialized areas.

7. **Are there any sudden changes or jumps in the tax values?**
   - Yes, tax values increase suddenly at certain points, likely due to specific tax policies.

## Analysis with Histogram and KDE Chart:
The **histogram** and **KDE chart** provided a clear visualization of the tax value distribution, highlighting peaks around **300 and 700**.

## Conclusion:
The analysis shows that tax values in the Boston Housing dataset follow a pattern that suggests specific tax bands or policies. Further investigation into correlations with housing prices and industrialization could offer deeper insights.
