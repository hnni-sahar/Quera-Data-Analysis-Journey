# qbc8-superstore

This repository contains the analysis and insights from the **Superstore** dataset as part of the **QBC8 Data Analysis Bootcamp** by Quera. The project is conducted by **Group 4**, consisting of **Sahar Hannani** and **Behrad Badeli**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Superstore dataset using various data analysis techniques, including **Machine Learning**, **Hypothesis Testing**, and **Power BI**. We used a variety of tools and techniques to generate valuable insights and predictions about the dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Key Methods and Techniques

### Machine Learning
In this project, we used **Random Forest** for both **regression** and **classification** tasks. We tuned the model using **Grid Search** and **Cross-Validation** to improve its accuracy. 

- **Random Forest**: Used to predict both shipping and profit outcomes based on various features of the Superstore dataset.
- **Grid Search and CV**: Utilized for hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal model performance.

### Hypothesis Testing
For the statistical analysis, we applied the **Mann-Whitney U test** to compare the distributions of two independent groups. This was due to the non-normality of the dataset. We also attempted a **log transformation** of the data to achieve normality, but it didn’t yield satisfactory results.

- **Mann-Whitney U test**: Used for non-parametric hypothesis testing, given the data’s non-normal distribution.
- **Log Transformation**: Attempted to normalize data for better hypothesis testing.

### Power BI
We used **Power BI** to create a **star schema**-based **data warehouse** and developed a **dashboard** to provide interactive visualizations of the Superstore data. The dashboard includes insights related to profits, sales, and shipping performance.

- **Star Schema**: Designed a data warehouse structure in Power BI to efficiently manage and analyze the data.
- **Dashboard**: Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance metrics and trends.

## Dependency Management

This project uses **Poetry** for dependency management, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment. To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:
